# The Investigator

An AI-powered security & network analyst I'm building across 8 weeks.

## Skills so far

- Week 1: Thinks like a security analyst (prompt library)
- Week 2: can triage suspicious emails — check headers
(SPF/DKIM/DMARC, Reply-To), flag urgency/secrecy/authority,
recommend out-of-band verification.
- Week 3: Can audit server logs for failed-login and brute-force patterns (see [audit.py](http://audit.py)).
- Week 4: *Can hunt network beaconing ([hunt.py](http://hunt.py)) and reconstruct an incident timeline from multiple logs to guide response ([timeline.py](http://timeline.py)).*
- Week 5: Runs an automated triage pipeline (GitHub Actions + a local Llama 3.2 model via Ollama) that reads the IR runbook, maps findings to MITRE ATT&CK, and writes a verified incident report.
- Week 6: A Streamlit SOC Copilot that correlates four telemetry sources (firewall, Sysmon, Windows, Suricata) via Groq and returns a triaged report with MITRE mapping, severity, and response plan.

More coming each week.
